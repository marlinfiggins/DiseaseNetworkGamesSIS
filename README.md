# DiseaseNetworkGamesSIS
The purpose of the repository is to hold the code used to simulate SIS and SIR network dynamics which take into account the optimal decisions individuals can make when they're presented with the problem of whether or not to isolate themselves in the event of a disease outbreak. We also have code to simualte what happens when indivudals choose non-optimally in order to investigate the effects of deviations from equilibrium given to us by the game-theoretic portion of the model.
